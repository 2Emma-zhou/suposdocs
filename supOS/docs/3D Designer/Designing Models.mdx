<li>Select <b>Front</b> or <b>Double</b> next to <b>Side</b> for rendering side.

- **Front**: The set effect will only be displayed on the outside of the model structure.
- **Double**: The set effect will be displayed on both the outside and the inside of the model structure.

</li>
<li>

Set the **UV Repeat** of the **Color Map** you uploaded, and set the color of the model structure you selected.

</li>
<li>

Adjust the **Opacity** of the selected model structure.

</li>
<li>

Upload **MR Map**, and adjust its **Roughness** and **Metalness** to achieve a metal-like effect.

</li>
<li>

Upload **Normal Map** to simulate the curves and ridges of the model structure surface.

</li>
<li>

Upload **Emissive Map** and set **Emissive** color to simulate an emissive light effect.
