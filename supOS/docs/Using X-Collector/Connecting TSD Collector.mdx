To connect a real-time data, video streams or alarm data to supOS, you need to perform operations shown as the figure below.

:::info
- Different collectors require different but similar configuration, and TSD collector is used as an example.
- Add a data source under **Global Configuration** > **Local Storage** which stores alarm data before adding an alarm collector.
:::

## Adding Collector

1. Log in to supOS, and then click <img src="https://wordpressfreezonex.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/platform/7.png"/> at the upper-right corner to go to the design center.
2. Select **Collection Node Management** > **Authentication**.
3. Click <img src="https://wordpressfreezonex.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/platform/16.png"/>, and then enter the corresponding information to add a collector.
4. Set the <strong>Type</strong> to <strong>Common Collector</strong>, and select the <strong>Timestamp</strong> to be recorded in the data.

5. Click <strong>OK</strong>.

## Authenticating Collector
Use the UUID generated on supOS, authenticate and connect supOS with the collector.

1. Log in to X-Collector, and then select **TSD Collector** > **Connection Info**.<br />
:::info what you might be interested
One collector can upload data to up to 5 supOS platforms simultaneously.
:::
2. Click **Add**, and then enter supOS information.

## Authorizing Collector

<ol>
<li>Log in to supOS, and then click <img src="https://wordpressfreezonex.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/platform/7.png"/> at the upper-right corner to go to the design center.</li>      
<li>Select <strong>Collection Node Management</strong> > <strong>Status</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the collector you just added, view the details and then click <strong>OK</strong>.
<ul>
<li>The collector is connected, and a new instance is created under <b>Object Model Management > Object Instance > Entity Template > Collector Template</b>.</li>
<li>An <b>Online</b> property with data type as <b>Bool</b> is generated under the instance, and you can use it in APP designing to indicate collector status (true means online and false is offline).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

:::info
- Video collector that is added to supOS platform generates a new instance under <b>Object Model Management > Object Instance > Entity Template > Video Template</b>.
- Alarm collector that is added to supOS platform generates a new instance under <b>Object Model Management > Object Instance > Entity Template > AE Template</b>.
