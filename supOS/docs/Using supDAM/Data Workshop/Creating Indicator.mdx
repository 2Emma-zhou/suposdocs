Create indicators to analyze data by different dimensions. Indicators can be added based on data models or SQL statements.
In this section, the table below is used as an example.

Indicators that will be demonstrated are:
- Total amount of oxygen produced by workshop A in a month.
- Total amount of nitrogen produced by workshop B in a month.

### Creating Indicator Based on Data Model
1. Log in to supOS, and then select **Data Intelligence** > **Data Workshop** > **Indicator management**.

### Creating Indicator from SQL

1. Select a directory, click **Add**, and then select **Create from SQL**.
2. Select the ODS table, and then write the SQL statement to get the total amount of nitrogen produced by workshop B in a month.
- When acquiring data from ODS tables, the prefix **ods.** must be added before the table name.
- **SELECT** statement does not support *****.
- The acquired data must contain at least one numeric field as the indicator.
:::tip
Click **Format** to format the SQL statements, and click **Query** to check the result and error messages.
