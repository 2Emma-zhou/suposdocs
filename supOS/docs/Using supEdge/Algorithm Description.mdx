The X-Edge platform provides 3 types of algorithms that you can directly upload after purchase.
## Exclusion Zone
For certain areas, for example, coal conveyor belts, confidential archive room or other dangerous equipment lab, people are not allowed to access. With cameras set up nearby and the exclusion algorithm, people without permissions attempting to access will trigger alarms.<br/>
The accuracy of the algorithm is over 95%, making it very effective in improving the efficiency of human supervision. It can be used for personnel safety detection in industrial areas, as well as platforms in high-speed trains, subways, and railway stations.

## Safety Helmet Recognition

The algorithm is primarily used in factory work areas to automatically identify people entering the work area.<br/>
If a person is detected without wearing a safety helmet, an alarm will be triggered immediately, and the alarm signal will be sent to the management staff. <br/>
This algorithm greatly improves the efficiency of managing the work area and ensures the safety of the workers.

## Conveyor Belt Mistracking
The algorithm is used to detect potential deviation issues in industrial conveyor belts. <br/>
- It automatically recognizes the degree of belt deviation and issues an alarm if any deviation occurs.
- It can also provide a warning if the belt appears to be continuously moving in one direction, indicating that deviation may occur soon.
This algorithm greatly improves the efficiency of maintaining belt conveyors in factories, prevents problems caused by belt deviation such as belt wear, uneven roller force, and scattered materials, and increases overall production efficiency.
