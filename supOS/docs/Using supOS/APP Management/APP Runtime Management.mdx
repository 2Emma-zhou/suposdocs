supOS supports installation of third-party applications with required packing methods, and running them on supOS.

## Setting Quota Verification
Running applications on supOS take up system resources. To prevent overuse of server resource, quota verification is necessary before installing application.

1. Log in to supOS, and then click <img src="https://wordpressfreezonex.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/factoryModeling/7.png" /> to go to the design center.
2. Select **APP Management** > **App Runtime Management**, and then enable **Quota verification** on the top.

:::info
- When **Quota verification** is disabled, no resource limits are applied.
- It can only be enabled when all installed applications are stopped.
