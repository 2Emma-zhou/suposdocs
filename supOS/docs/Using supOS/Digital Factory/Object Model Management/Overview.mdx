## Object Template vs Object Instance

Refer to the following examples to understand the relation between an object template, an instance and attributes.

<table>
  <thead>
<tr>
<th>Template</th>
<th>Template Attribute</th>
<th>Instance</th>
<th>Instance Attribute</th>
</tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
<tr>
<td>Workshop A</td>
<td>product volume, electricity</td>
<td>Furnace, boiler, shelf</td>
<td>Furnace pressure, furnace humidity, boiler temperature, shelf height</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Furnace</td>
<td>Temperature, pressure, humidity</td>
<td>Furnace A</td>
<td>Height, productivity, consumption</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Staff</td>
<td>Age, gender, name</td>
<td>Staff A</td>
<td>Birth date, post</td>
</tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

:::info
All template attributes will be inherited by the subordinate instances. For example, from the above staff example, staff A will have attributes including age, gender, name, birth date and post.
