This document is to demonstrate the process of deploying the programmable component on supOS platform to local environment, so you can upload third-party libraries and develop your own react programm on local IDEs.
:::info
Presently, only VSCode is supported for local deployment and development.
:::

## Deployment Process
### Local Dependencies
- Nodejs V12
- VSCode plugin: supOS-vscode-editor-2
- NPM packages: yo and generator-supos-cli
:::tip
The local depolyment of programmable component is recommended to work with Nodejs V12.
:::
### Deploying to Local
1.  After installing Nodejs, open cmd, and then install yo and generator-supos-cli.
```nodejs
npm install -g yo generator-supos-cli
```
2. Start yo.
```
yo
```
3. Connect to supOS and select an application to synchronize local data.
<ol>
<li>Select <b>Supos Cli</b>, press Enter, and then enter a folder name for the project.</li>
<li>Select protocol type based on your supOS platform from <b>http</b> and <b>https</b>.</li>
<li>Enter the platform IP address with port number, or directly domain name.</li>
<li>Enter the platform login username and password.

:::info
The password is invisivle. Press Enter after entering.
:::

</li>
<li>Select an existing application on supOS, decide whether to create a github repository, and then initiate the project.</li>
</ol>

:::info
If you cannot initiate the project, download the package [here](https://wordpressfreezonex.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/programmableComponent/programmable%20component.7z) and change the platform and application information to connect to corresponding app.

## Uploading Third-party Library
The programmable component supports React language, and embeds 3 third-party libraries such as MOMENT, LODASH and ANTDESIGN that you can directly use. Follow the instructions to upload more libraries.
1. Search for and install the **supos-vscode-editor-2** plugin on VSCode.
2. Open a terminal on VSCode, and then install libraries you need.<br />
Here we use **echarts** as an example.
```nodejs
npm install echarts
```
3. Upload the library to supOS platform.<br />
Once the library is successfully uploaded, there will be an **echarts.js** file under the automatically generated path **src/out/libs**. 
```nodejs
npm run build:libs
```
## Publishing Local Program to supOS
You can synchronize details of existing programmable components inside the application from supOS platform, and publish local programs to the platform.
1. Press **ctrl+shift+p** in VSCode, and then enter **sync** to search for the corresponding SVE command.
2. Click the **SVE:sync** command to synchronize details of existing programmable components.<br />
- The existing components will be displayed under the path **src/controls/component name**, and the detailed code will be inside the **index.js** file under the folder.
- If there is no existing components, you need to create the path **src/controls/component name**, and create a **index.js** file under the folder.
:::tip
You can copy the initial code from the programmable component on supOS.
:::
3. Write your react program in the index file. <br />
For example:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import * as echarts from 'echarts';

class CustomComp extends Component {
    componentDidMount() {
        this.getChart()
    }
    getChart = () => {
        var myChart = echarts.init(document.getElementById('main'));
        // draw charts
        myChart.setOption({
            title: {
                text: 'ECharts example'
            },
            tooltip: {},
            xAxis: {
                data: ['shirt', 'cashmere', 'T-shirt', 'pants', 'heels', 'socks']
            },
            yAxis: {},
            series: [
                {
                    name: 'Sale',
                    type: 'bar',
                    data: [5, 20, 36, 10, 10, 20]
                }
            ]
        });
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div id='main' style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }}></div>
        );
    }
}

export default CustomComp;
```
4. Press **ctrl+shift+p** in VSCode, and then enter **publish** to search for the corresponding SVE command. <br />
- **SVE:publish**: You need to specify the folder name to publish.
- **SVE:publish all**: Publish all folders to supOS which may take more unneccessary time.
:::info
All resources are uploaded to the **Static Resource Management** on supOS.
:::
5. Click the **SVE:publish** command from the search results, and then enter the folder name to be published.
6. Go to supOS platform, inside the corresponding application, drag a programmable component, and set its name to the folder name created on local.
7. Save and preview the page, you can see the effect of code written on local.
