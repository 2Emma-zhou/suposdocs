Create experiments with data from sample sets and analysis algorithms to form custom algorithm models.
1. Log in to supOS, and then select **Data Intelligence** > **Data Science** > **Bigdata Analysis** > **Experiment Design**.
2. Click **Add**, and then select **Empty experiment**.
3. Drag the **Input** component from the left side to the canvas, and then click on the component.
4. On the right side, click **Select object**, and then select a sample set to be the input data source.

5. Select components from the left to form the algorithm model according to specific requirements.
- Click a component, and configure its parameters on the right.
- Click a component, and you can see the definition of it at the lower-right corner.

6. Click **Debug**, the result of the model will be displayed on the right under **Insight**.
- Click a component, and its insight results are displayed on the right.
- Click **Configuration info** on the insight results to check the detailed configuration of each component.
