Calling multiple models at the same time through data tasks.
:::info
In this section, 2 bigdata models will be called as an example of usage.
:::
1. Log in to supOS, and then select **Data Intelligence** > **Data Science** > **Model Scheduling** > **Multi Model**.
2. Add a directory and create a data task.
:::info
This part is similar to data task development in X-ETL. For details, see <a href="../Using supETL/Configuring Data Task">Configuring Data Task</a>.

3. Drag **Data input**, **Model operation**, **Generate sample set** and **Data output** to the canvas, and then connect them as the image shows.

<ol>
<li>Select a supOS instance that is added under <b>Data Integration Exchange</b> > <b>Data connection</b>.</li>
<li>Select a model that is published in X-BD.</li>
<li>Map the input data with the model input fields, and then save the configuration.</li>
</ol>

6. Select an output source, and then click **Debug**.
7. After successful debugging, check whether the results are right.
- Check the set output source to see whether the data is processed by the model.
- Under **Sample set**, check whether the sample set is created and with the right data.
