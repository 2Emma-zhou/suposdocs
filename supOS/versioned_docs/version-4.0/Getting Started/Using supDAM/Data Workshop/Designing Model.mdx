Create table models and map data from the local data warehouse for clear management and subsequent indicator-oriented statistical data integration.
There are 3 types of table models:
- DIM: Dimension table.
- DWD: Details data table.
- DWS: Integrated data table.

In this section, the following original table is used as an example to demonstrate the process of modeling.
- **product**, **date** and **workshop** are used as dimensions.
- DWD table contains all details on the table.

:::info
Start **Entire library migration** on X-ETL to migrate the **Product** table to the local data warehouse. For details, see <a href="../../Using supETL/Migrating Database">Migrating Database</a>.

### Creating DIM Model
1. Log in to supOS, and then select **Data Intelligence** > **Data Workshop** > **Data modeling** > **Model design**.
2. Select **DIM**, click ![](https://wordpressfreezonex.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/supDAM/34.png),and then enter the basic information on the pop-up window.

3. Click <b>Attribute field</b> on the left side, and then enter the dimension attribute.

4. On the <b>Physicalize</b> tab, select <b>Associate physical table</b> as physicalization type.

- Associate physical table: Link the DIM model with physical table in local data warehouse.
- Generate physical table: Generate an empty physical in the data warehouse, which can be filled through data tasks in X-ETL.

For details, see <a href="../../Using supETL/Configuring Data Task">Configuring Data Task</a>.
:::
- Sync to MQ: Sync changing data to message queue for X-ETL usage.

5. Select a physical table, and then map physical table fields with the DIM field.

- Sequential mapping: Map same type of fields in order.
- Name mapping: Map fields with the same name.
- Manual manpping: Manual mapping and different types of fields can be mapped with automatically changed types.

6. Click <b>Data standards</b>, drag and drop a standard to the model to link a standard field.

:::info
- **Version** tab is used to compare model difference after update.
- **Data preview** is only available after publishing the model and it displays all mapped data from the physical data.
:::

7. Close the model detail tab, and then click **Save** and **Publish** at the top.
8. Repeat step 2 to create 2 more DIM models with **product** and **workshop** as dimensions.

### Creating DWD Model
Click **DWD**, similar to DIM creation, add same fields as the physical table and map with it.

### Creating DWS Model
1. Click **DWS**, create a DWS model, and then drag all DIM and DWD table to the canvas.
2. Draw lines from the DWD model to all 3 DIM models, and then double-click the connection lines and set their link types.
- Left link: Returns all data on the left table and data conforms to the association conditions.
- Inner link: Returns data conforms to the association conditions.
3. Click **New** to add association conditions.
:::info
Multiple conditions are available.

4. Click <b>Attribute field</b> on the left side, and then check the integrated fields and adjust as needed.
5. On the <b>Physicalize</b> tab, leave it to <b>Local view</b>.
:::info
**Materialized view** is unavailable presently.

6. Close the model detail tab, and then click **Save** and **Publish** at the top.
