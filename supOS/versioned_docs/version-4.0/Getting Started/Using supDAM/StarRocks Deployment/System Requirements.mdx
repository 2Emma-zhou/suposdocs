</td>
<td>

- For FE/BE nodes, we recommend 4 cores or more CPU and 4 GB or larger RAM.
- Run `cat /p/proc/cpuinfo fo |grep avx2` to check the instruction set the CPU supports, and AVX2 is available when results are returned.

- Based on different workload complexities, StarRocks can process 10 M to 100 M rows of data per second per CPU thread. You can use this to estimate how many CPU threads your cluster needs. 
- StarRocks uses columnar storage and compression to achieve a compression ratio of 4-10 times when storing data. You can use this information to estimate the storage capacity needed for your cluster.
