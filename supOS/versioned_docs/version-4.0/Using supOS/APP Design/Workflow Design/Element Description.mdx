:::info
- For <strong>Start event</strong>, the workflow is directly initiated. We recommend to start a user task with the initiator as the executor for the next step. When the workflow is started, the user task is executed by default.
- If the executor of the next step after <strong>Start event</strong> is not the initiator, when starting the workflow, the form of the step after.

### Timer Event

A timer event sets the deadline time of current task or the last task. It can be used in following ways:
- Place it between two tasks, and the second task only starts when reaching the set time.
- Place it on a task, and if the task is finished before the set time, the timer becomes invalid; if not, the subsequent branch task of the timer is triggered.

### Signal Event

Normally it is used in pairs between main and sub processes with the same signal source bound. One event throws a signal after completing the current workflow and another event catches the signal and starts corresponding workflow.

### Task Executor Configuration


This section demonstrates the process of configuring task executors.

1. Click <strong>Config</strong> next to <strong>Executor</strong>, and then click <strong>New</strong>.
2. On the added record, click the drop-down list under <strong>Type</strong>, and then click <strong>Select</strong> to select executors.

<ul>
<ul>
<li>When selecting <strong>Staff</strong>, if cross company is enabled for the workflow, you can select staff from other companies.</li>
<li>When selecting <strong>Role</strong>, <strong>Department</strong> and <strong>Position</strong>, all staff linked to the role, department and position are set to the task executors.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

3. Set restrictions to executors.

<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post restrictions</strong>: Enable it and the executor can only process forms submitted by corresponding subordinates. For example, in the figure below, when <strong>Post restrictions</strong> are enabled for B and C, then forms submitted by A can only be reviewed by B and C.
<img width={450} height={300} src="https://wordpressfreezonex.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/workflow/30.png"/>
</li>
<li><strong>Designated position</strong>: Select a position and grant corresponding permissions to the executor. For example, assign department manager of R&amp;D to D in test department, then D can review forms submitted by A and B.
<img width={450} height={300} src="https://wordpressfreezonex.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/workflow/31.png"/>
</li>
<li><strong>Designated staff</strong>: Select a staff, and then the executor can only review forms submitted by the designated staff.</li>
<li><strong>Unlimited</strong>: No restrictions on the executor.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

4. Select executor types.

:::info
The task will be sent to both selected types of and designated executors.
:::

5. Click <strong>Confirm</strong>.

## Subprocess

A subprocess is a part of a workflow. It is generally started with a signal event and triggered by signals thrown by multiple tasks in main process.

## Gateway

### Definition
Gateway decides how subsequent process is proceeded based on different gateway types.

- <strong>Exclusive</strong>: Execute only one subsequent branch process that meets the requirements.

:::info
Branches after an exclusive gateway must be configured with conditions.
:::

- <strong>Parallel</strong>: Execute all subsequent branch processes without any conditions.

:::info
Multiple branches before parallel gateway are available and subsequent processes will only be executed after all pre-branches are finished.
:::

- <strong>Inclusive</strong>: Execute subsequent branch processes that either meet the requirements or without any conditions.

<img width={450} height={300} src="https://wordpressfreezonex.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/workflow/28.png" />

### Setting Condition

Click the connection lines after the gateway to set conditions of corresponding branch.

- <strong>Assignee</strong>: Allows you to select a receiver for the subsequent process on the linked page of last step.
- <strong>Expression</strong>: Set conditions to decide whether to execute subsequent processes.

<img width={450} height={300} src="https://wordpressfreezonex.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/workflow/32.png" />

## End

The element that ends the workflow.
- <strong>End event</strong>: End the current branch process.
- <strong>Terminate event</strong>: Terminate the whole workflow. When used in a sub-process, enable <strong>Terminate all</strong> to end the whole process. Otherwise, only the sub-process is ended.

## Connection Line

Connects steps and tasks to make sure the workflow proceeds in correct order.

:::info
A task can be connected to one or more tasks, and when necessary, subsequent reviewer can revoke the task to previous submitter.
