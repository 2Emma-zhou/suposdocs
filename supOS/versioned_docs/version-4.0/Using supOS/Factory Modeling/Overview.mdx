## Object Template vs Object Instance

Refer to the following examples to understand the relation between an object template, an instance and attributes.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Template</th>
      <th>Template Attribute</th>
      <th>Instance</th>
      <th>Instance Attribute</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Workshop A</td>
      <td>product volume, electricity</td>
      <td>Furnace, boiler, shelf</td>
      <td>Furnace pressure, furnace humidity, boiler temperature, shelf height</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Furnace</td>
      <td>Temperature, pressure, humidity</td>
      <td>Furnace A</td>
      <td>Height, productivity, consumption</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Staff</td>
      <td>Age, gender, name</td>
      <td>Staff A</td>
      <td>Birth date, post</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

:::info
All template attributes will be inherited by the subordinate instances. For example, from the above staff example, staff A will have attributes including age, gender, name, birth date and post.
